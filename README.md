# FRM_SerialSet
FRM_SerialSet is an interactive WinForms application written purely in C#. It allows Users to connect with other computers via a Serial Port Connection.
The Application uses C#'s very own in-built serial class to create the connection between the two computers.
There is also another class implemented which creates query strings according to the rules given by the Host Link Communication Protocol for Omron PLCs. See http://media.klinkmann.com/servers/docs/480xxm11.pdf
